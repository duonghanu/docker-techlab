# Docker Lab: Getting Started

Previously in the lab...

Question: What's next?
Answer: Let's get the Docker party started!

## The Command Line Tool

With Docker installed and working, now's the time to become familiar with the command line utility. Using Docker consists of passing at least a command. `docker --help` shows the available options:

```bash
$ docker --help
Usage: docker COMMAND

A self-sufficient runtime for containers

Options:
      --config string      Location of client config files (default "/home/user/.docker")
  -D, --debug              Enable debug mode
      --help               Print usage
  -H, --host list          Daemon socket(s) to connect to
  -l, --log-level string   Set the logging level ("debug"|"info"|"warn"|"error"|"fatal") (default "info")
      --tls                Use TLS; implied by --tlsverify
      --tlscacert string   Trust certs signed only by this CA (default "/home/user/.docker/ca.pem")
      --tlscert string     Path to TLS certificate file (default "/home/user/.docker/cert.pem")
      --tlskey string      Path to TLS key file (default "/home/user/.docker/key.pem")
      --tlsverify          Use TLS and verify the remote
  -v, --version            Print version information and quit

  pause       Pause all processes within one or more containers
  port        List port mappings or a specific mapping for the container
  ps          List containers
  pull        Pull an image or a repository from a registry
  push        Push an image or a repository to a registry
  rename      Rename a container
  restart     Restart one or more containers
  rm          Remove one or more containers
  rmi         Remove one or more images
  run         Run a command in a new container
  save        Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
  search      Search the Docker Hub for images
  start       Start one or more stopped containers
  stats       Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
  stop        Stop one or more running containers
  tag         Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
  top         Display the running processes of a container
  unpause     Unpause all processes within one or more containers
  update      Update configuration of one or more containers
  version     Show the Docker version information
  wait        Block until one or more containers stop, then print their exit codes

Run 'docker COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

To view the switches available to a specific command, type:

`docker docker-subcommand --help`

To view system-wide information about Docker, use:

`docker info`


## Hello World (with Docker images)

Docker containers are run from Docker images. By default, it pulls these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry managed by Docker Inc, the company behind the Docker project. Anybody can build and host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so most applications and Linux distributions you'll need to run Docker containers have images that are hosted on Docker Hub.

To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:

`docker run hello-world`

The output, which should include the following, indicates that Docker appears to be working correctly:

```bash
Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
```

## Our First Container :)

With this command we now run on our computers our first container. It ran a simple process that printed a message to standard out. The container is not very useful though.

## Additional Lab: Getting Familiar With the Docker Docs

Browse <https://docs.docker.com> and get familiar with the docs and the references. In this techlab we're using Docker CE so this is the docs section you might want to check out as well.

Question: Is there only a "hello world" Docker image?

Maybe the next Lab will provide some answers?
