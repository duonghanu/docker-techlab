# Docker Lab: Environment Variables

Previously in the lab...

An error is popping up!

```bash
error: database is uninitialized and password option is not specified
  You need to specify one of MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD and MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD
```

Question: What's wrong? Am I an idiot?

Answer: No! You have just done what was stated in the instructions.

## Environment Variables

What happened?
The mariadb server is not able to run without a proper configuration. Docker has the possibility to pass variables into the instantiation process via environment variables.
Environment variables are passed via the parameter `-e` e.g.

`docker run -it -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw mariadb`

Once you run the command you will see an output like this:

```bash

Initializing database

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

'/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
'/usr/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h  password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
'/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://mariadb.com/kb or the
MySQL manual for more instructions.

The problem is that you are now stuck in this console.
To return to your shell press `CTRL p` and than `CTRL q`
This will leave the container running while you are back in your shell. To see that the container is really running use the command:

`docker container ls`

The output should look much like this:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
7cb31f821233        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        3306/tcp            upbeat_blackwell
```

To connect to the container again you can use the following command:

`docker exec -it [CONTAINER ID|NAME] bash`

**Note:** The docker exec command needs either the `CONTAINER_ID` or `NAME` of the container. And additionally, at the end, an executable.

In this example it's `bash` as we want to do something interactively in the container.

Once the command is executed you should see this:

`root@7cb31f821233:/#`

**Note:** Every time you connect yourself to a container you will always be the user that was defined as user in the Dockerfile.

Now that we are connected lets find out if the mariadb is working...

`root@7cb31f821233:/# mysql -uroot -pmy-secret-pw`

If everything works as expected you should now see the mariadb command line:

```bash
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MariaDB connection id is 8
Server version: 10.3.8-MariaDB-1:10.3.8+maria~jessie mariadb.org binary distribution

Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]>
```

## Daemons

One might think: *This whole starting process is a bit freaky with `CTRL p` and then `CTRL q`*.
Therefore you can run a Docker container "daemonized".
You just have to add the parameter `-d` to the Docker `run` command e.g.:

```bash
$ docker run -it -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb
699e82ed8f1f7c6d4316f26bcdb5d03164610840315aaa587a87672591401041

```

If you now have a look into the container list you should come up with two running containers:

```bash
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
699e82ed8f1f        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes        3306/tcp            jolly_bardeen
7cb31f821233        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   32 minutes ago      Up 32 minutes       3306/tcp            upbeat_blackwell
```

Question: Do we need two running mariadb containers at the same time for this lab?

Find out in the next lab.
